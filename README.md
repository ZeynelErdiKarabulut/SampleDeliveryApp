# SampleDeliveryApp

This application was made like a Yemeksepeti Mobile Android App


There are pages that welcome you to login and register to the application. You can also view and update your information on my profile page after logging in.
You can view the restaurants belonging to that cuisine from the cuisine types on the home page. You can also access the details of restaurants. On the detail page, you can see the location of that restaurant on Google Map, as well as details such as the score and minimum delivery fee. You can add restaurants to your favourites. You can also see the meals of that restaurant from the restaurant details and add them to your cart.
You can remove or buy the products you have added to the cart.
You can view the products purchased in your recent orders and contribute to the restaurant score by voting. <br/>
